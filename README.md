# FaceNet-Marvel_Face_Recognition
1) Face Recognition on the Avengers dataset (easy dataset)
2) Used Transfer Learning on FaceNet, a State-of-the-Art Face Recognition Model
3) Extracted Face embeddings using pre-trained FaceNet model
4) Used SVC classifier to classify various faces
Currently, implementing other models to learn more about face recognition models.
